# FiveM Scripts Archive
An archive of all the custom scripts for my FiveM server. Vue.JS and Howler.JS are used in some places, but they are included with the resource. Some scripts have been sourced from other sources, but they have been extensively modified to fit the needs of my server, to the point of being unrecognizable.

Most scripts should work on their own, however some scripts require ace permissions to be setup to function correctly, some scripts also require Discord webhooks to work.
